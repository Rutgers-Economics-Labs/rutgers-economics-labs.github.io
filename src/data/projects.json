This project will produce a reference framework for planning and policy by extrapolating long-term demographic trends, accounting for demographic shifts revealed by the 2020 Decennial Census and COVID-19 pandemic impacts. The project will develop three distinct scenarios (Medium, High-Growth, and Low-Growth) based on different assumptions about the components of population change.",

The research will identify regions where formerly incarcerated individuals return, analyze regional labor market structures, and assess alignment between available 'second-chance' employment opportunities and vocational skills. The project will produce a five-year projection of employment trends to inform policy and workforce development strategies, ultimately identifying systemic barriers and providing actionable recommendations for successful reentry.",
